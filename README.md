# Electronic-_circuit_with_5_servo_motors

To design an electrical circuit that controls the rotation of 5 servo motors, we need to:

1) 5 servo motors

2) Breadboard

3) Arduino

4) wires

You have to know that it's necessary to use a transistor to reduce the power.

This circuit will move the servo motors from a 0° to 90° angle.
